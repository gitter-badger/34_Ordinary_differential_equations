\begin{document}
For every self-consistent matrix norm, $||\cdot||$, and every square matrix $\mv{A}$ we can write\\
\begin{displaymath}
\rho(\mv{A})=\lim_{n \to \infty} ||\mv{A}^n||^{\frac{1}{n}}.
\end{displaymath}\\

Note: $\rho(\mv{A})$ denotes the spectral radius of $\mv{A}$.

This theorem also generalizes to infinite dimensions and plays an important role in the theory of operator algebras.  If $\mathcal{A}$ is a Banach algebra with norm $||\cdot||$ and $A \in \mathcal{A}$, then we have\\
\begin{displaymath}
\rho(\mv{A})=\lim_{n \to \infty} ||\mv{A}^n||^{\frac{1}{n}}.
\end{displaymath}\\

It is worth pointing out that the self-consistency condition which was imposed on the matrix norm is part of the definition of a Banach algebra.  A common case of the infinite-dimensional generalization  occurs when $\mathcal{A}$ is the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space --- the operators may be regarded as an infinite-dimensional generalization of the square matrices.
