Suppose that there exists a periodic solution called $\Gamma$ which has a period of $T$ and lies in $E$.  Let the interior of $\Gamma$ be denoted by $D$.  Then by Green's Theorem we can observe that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int\!\!\!\int_D \nabla \cdot \textbf{f}\: \ud x\, \ud y & = & \int\!\!\!\int_D \frac{\partial \textbf{X}}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \textbf{Y}}{\partial y}\: \ud x\, \ud y\\
& = & \oint_{\Gamma} (\textbf{X} \: \ud y - \textbf{Y} \: \ud x)\\
& = & \int_0^T (\textbf{X}\dot{y} - \textbf{Y}\dot{x})\: \ud t\\
& = & \int_0^T (\textbf{XY} - \textbf{YX})\: \ud t\\
& = & 0
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $\nabla \cdot \textbf{f}$ is not identically zero by hypothesis and is of one sign, the double integral on the left must be non zero and of that sign.  This leads to a contradiction since the right hand side is equal to zero.  Therefore there does not exists a periodic solution in the simply connected region $E$.
