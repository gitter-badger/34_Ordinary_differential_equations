Let $N$ be a natural number. Consider the equation
$$x^2+y^2=N$$
Let $L(N)$ denote the number of naturals $z \leq N$ such that the equation $x^2+y^2=z$ has at least one integer solution $(x,y)$.
The Laudau-Ramanujan constant is defined as the limit
$$\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} \frac{L(N)\sqrt{\log(N)}}{N}\approx 0.76422365358922066299069873125$$
