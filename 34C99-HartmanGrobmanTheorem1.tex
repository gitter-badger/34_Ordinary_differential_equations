Consider the differential equation
\begin{equation}
x'=f(x)
\label{eq}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is a $C^1$ vector field. Assume that $x_0$ is a hyperbolic equilibrium of $f$. Denote $\Phi_t(x)$ the flow of (\ref{eq}) through $x$ at time $t$. Then there exists a homeomorphism $\varphi(x)=x+h(x)$ with $h$ bouded, such that
\[
\varphi\circ e^{tDf(x_0)}=\Phi_t\circ\varphi
\]
is a sufficiently small neighboorhood of $x_0$.

This fundamental theorem in the qualitative analysis of nonlinear differential equations states that, in a small neighborhood of $x_0$, the flow of the nonlinear equation (\ref{eq}) is qualitatively similar to that of the linear system $x'=Df(x_0)x$.
