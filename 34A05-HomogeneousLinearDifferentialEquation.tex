The linear differential equation
\begin{align}
a_n(x)y^{(n)}+a_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)}+\ldots+a_1(x)y'+a_0(x)y \;=\; b(x)
\end{align}
is called 
\PMlinkname{{\it homogeneous}}{HomogeneousLinearDifferentialEquation} 
iff\, $b(x) \equiv 0$.\, If\, $b(x) \not\equiv 0$, 
the equation (1) is {\it inhomogeneous}.\\
If (1) is \PMlinkname{homogeneous}{HomogeneousLinearDifferentialEquation}, 
then the sum of any solutions is a solution and any solution 
multiplied by a constant is a solution.\\

The special case 
$$c_nx^ny^{(n)}+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}y^{(n-1)}+\ldots+c_1xy'+c_0y \;=\; 0$$
of (1), where the $c_i$'s are constants, can via the 
substitution\, $x = e^t$\, be transformed into a homogeneous 
linear differential equation of the same order but with 
constant coefficients.\\
