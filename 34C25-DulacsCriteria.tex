\begin{document}
Let
\begin{center}
$\dot{\textbf{x}} = \textbf{f}(\textbf{x})$
\end{center}
be a planar system where $\textbf{f} = (\textbf{X},\textbf{Y})^t$ and $\textbf{x} = (x,y)^t$. Furthermore $\textbf{f} \in C^1(E)$ where $E$ is a simply connected region of the plane. If there exists a function $p(x,y)\in C^1(E)$ such that $\frac{\partial (p(x,y)\textbf{X})}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial (p(x,y)\textbf{Y})}{\partial y}$ \textit{(the divergence of the vector field $p(x,y)\textbf{f}$, $\nabla \cdot p(x,y)\textbf{f}$)} is always of the same sign but not identically zero then there are no periodic solution in the region $E$ of the planar system.  In addition, if $A$ is an annular region contained in $E$ on which the above condition is satisfied then there exists at most one periodic solution in $A$.
