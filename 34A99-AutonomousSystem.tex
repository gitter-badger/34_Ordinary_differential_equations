\begin{document}
A system of ordinary differential equation is \emph{autonomous} when it does not depend on time \textit{(does not depend on the independent variable)} i.e. $\dot{x}=f(x)$.  In contrast \emph{nonautonomous} is when the system of ordinary differential equation does depend on time \textit{(does depend on the independent variable)} i.e. $\dot{x}=f(x,t)$.\\

It can be noted that every nonautonomous system can be converted to an autonomous system by adding a dimension. i.e. If $\dot{\textbf{x}}=\textbf{f}(\textbf{x},t)$ $\textbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ then it can be written as an autonomous system with $\textbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and by doing a substitution with $x_{n+1} = t$ and $\dot{x}_{n+1}=1$.
