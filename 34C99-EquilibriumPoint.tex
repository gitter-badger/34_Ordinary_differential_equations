Consider an autonomous differential equation
\begin{equation}
\dot{x}=f(x).
\label{eq}
\end{equation}
\\

An \emph{equilibrium point} $x_0$ of (\ref{eq}) is such that $f(x_0)=0$.  Conversely a \emph{regular point} of (\ref{eq}) is such that $f(x_0)\neq 0$.

If the linearization $Df(x_0)$ has no eigenvalue with zero real 
part, $x_0$ is said to be a hyperbolic equilibrium, whereas if 
there exists an eigenvalue with zero real part, the equilibrium 
point is nonhyperbolic.\\

An equilibrium point $x_0$ is said to be \emph{stable} if for 
every neighborhood $x_0$,$U$ there exists a neighborhood 
of $x_0$, $U'\subset U$ such that every solution of (\ref{eq}) 
with initial condition in $U'$ \textit{(i.e. $x(0)\in U'$)}, 
satisfies
$$x(t)\in U$$
for all $t\geq0$.\\

Consequently an equilibrium point $x_0$ is said to be 
\emph{unstable} if it is not stable.\\

Moreover an equilibrium point $x_0$ is said to be 
\emph{asymptotically stable} if it is stable and there exists 
$U''$ such that every solution of (\ref{eq}) with initial 
condition in $U''$ \textit{(i.e. $x(0)\in U''$)} satisfies
$$\lim_{t\to\infty}x(t)=x_0.$$
