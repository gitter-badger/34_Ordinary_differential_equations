\begin{document}
Let $E\subset W$ where $W$ is a normed vector space, $f\in C^1(E)$ is a continuous differentiable map $f: E \to W$.  Furthermore consider the ordinary differential equation
$$\dot{x} = f(x)$$
with the initial condition
\begin{center}
$x(0) = x_0$.
\end{center}
For all $x_0 \in E$ there exists a unique solution
$$x:I \to E$$
where $I = [-a,a]$, which also satify the initial condition of the initial value problem.  Then there exists a maximal interval of existence $J=( \alpha ,\beta )$ such that $I\subset J$ and there exists a unique solution   
\begin{center}
$x:J \to E$.
\end{center}
