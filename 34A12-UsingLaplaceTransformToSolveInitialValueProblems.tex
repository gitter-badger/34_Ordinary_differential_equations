\begin{document}
Since the Laplace transforms of the derivatives of $f(t)$ are 
polynomials in the transform parameter $s$ (see table of Laplace 
transforms), forming the Laplace transform of a linear differential 
equation with constant coefficients and initial conditions at\, 
$t = 0$ yields generally a simple equation 
(\PMlinkname{image equation}{imageequation}) for solving the transformed function $F(s)$.\, Since the initial conditions can be taken into consideration instantly, one needs not to determine the general solution of the differential equation.

For example, transforming the equation
$$f''(t)+2f'(t)+f(t) = e^{-t} 
\qquad (f(0) = 0,\;\; f'(0) = 1)$$
gives
$$[s^2F(s)-sf(0)-f'(0)]+2[sF(s)-f(0)]+F(s) = \frac{1}{s+1},$$
i.e. 
$$(s^2+2s+1)F(s) = 1+\frac{1}{s+1},$$
whence
$$F(s) = \frac{1}{(s+1)^2}+\frac{1}{(s+1)^3}.$$
Taking the inverse Laplace transform produces the result
$$f(t) \,=\, te^{-t}+\frac{t^2e^{-t}}{2} \;=\; \frac{e^{-t}}{2}(t^2+2t).$$
